            Generally arbitral institutions in India apart from charging
            registration and administration fees also have a fee structure based
            on claim amount involved in dispute and / or fees of the arbitrator
            / mediator per session or per day. ICDR believes that same fee
            structure may not be suitable in all cases across the board. Since
            parties expect flexibility and cost effectiveness in ADR
            proceedings, ICDR does not prescribe a rigid schedule of fees. Fees
            can be ascertained in advance after taking into account the nature
            of dispute, complexity of issues, level of stakes and the stature
            and seniority of the arbitrator / mediator. In all cases, ICDR will
            ensure that costs to the parties are reasonable and not left
            open-ended. In the event that parties are not agreeable to the fee
            structure proposed by ICDR then the parties can opt to pay arbitral
            fees as prescribed under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
